## Conflict Plan
for the confluct plan we will be using the **Collaborating** approach for the most important situations, 
it offers a good oppertrunity to learn from others,
> **Treats conflicts as a problem to be solved by examining alternatives**

#### What is the group process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
1. > First we check it's source and where it came from,
2. > Second we'll check if it's solvable, 
3. > Third we'll ask my team for help if it's not solved, 
4. > Last we'll ask the TA's or the istructor for help ASAP.

#### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
> me personally I don't like to put any conserns on my team, but just in case I'll remindfe them that they don't work alone anymore 
> and if anyone didn't do thair part of work everyone will be effected and we are all in the same bus.

#### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
> in casae the conflict was that hard id unsolvable, I'll send them ASAP.


## Work Plan

#### How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
> for communications , I've created a private channel on slack with all of us to talk on, 
> and if there was some major problems we can start a zoom meeting for.
> communication on zoom/remo: from 9am - 5pm, Texting on slack: anytime.


#### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
> as a team leader my job is to ensure that all my team members are satisfied and have no problems, 
> and in case there was a problem between members I'll send them private messages to clearify fthe problem and solve it.


#### How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
I'll do my best to make the environment as freindly as possible.


## Git Process

#### What components of your project will live on GitHub?
> public file, server.js file, README file, license file.


#### How will you share the repository with your teammates?
> by creating an organization and grant them access to modify the any thing in the repo.

#### What is your Git flow?
